# Account balances

Set account balances up to look like an equation, where you have Total = ( cleared + uncleared ) in both the header and the individual rows. Maybe add these signs in their own grid columns so they have good spacing from the values. If the cleared and uncleared would be dashes (meaning there is no uncleared abalances), then don't show the equation. Apply this to both the settings/accounts as well as the month/balance/accounts pages

# This Session

Sticky header settings/account has a gap above it that shows background content when you scroll down. Due to the gap between the column headers and the stats row above it. Let's leave the spacing, do it in a way that doesn't leave a gap to see behind content.

When showing OFF BUDGET badge, don't show (type). Same to any other of these badges on the settings/account page

Let's right-align the buttons on the settins account/category groups, so they are more aligned with the "actions" columns that the individual rows use

When clicking between settings/accounts and settings/categories, there is aplit second on categories where all the values aren't populated yet (looks like maybe three dots). Why is this happening? Also, sometimes it looks like they are different values, and then they change a split second after the page loads. Why?

Credit cards should be showing negative signs when balances are negative, Right now it looks like they drop that sign, or sometimes include it and sometimes don't.

# Other

Click on account or category to edit

Order of columns should match on all budget category views

Modals need to show up above the sticky headers

When you save a category as hidden, then go to the bottom section and expand, it still shows the open form.

Can't drag-select account values because drag to move is triggering even when outside the drag button

We shouldn't allow accounts to go negative. We should flag as an error and require it to be fixed. If this happens during an import, we should also flag it, but allow the import and callout the accounts that are negative for any period of time.

Transfer form doesn't allow leaving account form blank

Logging out doesn't invalidate all local storage

Only have expenses change the account balance if "cleared".
