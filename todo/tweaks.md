Should we not save balances and things on the firestore documents that we can re-calculate locally?

Make the budget settings account/category edit/create forms full-page instead of inline

Let's change the blue check mark to a button that says either add or save, depending on if this is editing or adding a row. this applies to the income / spend / adjustments etc, (basically all forms)

For mobile views, let's not have an edit button but just open the edit form if a user clicks on a row (for budget settings accounts / categories, as well as month income / spend / adjustments / transfers). Is there a way we can do this while still allowing mobile users to hold to highlight / copy amounts?

When we're on the month that page that matches the current month (based on the calendar), then instead of end for the column name we should say current.

When looking at future months, let's avoid showing the start and end month values, since those are practically guaranteed to change before we actually get to that month.

Have download have date instead of timestamp in download, to make it easier to human read

Don't auto-focus amount when creating adjustments

On the my-budgets page (since it's the landing page) Give a go-to-budget button on the budget line, or when creating a budget, auto-take them to that budget
