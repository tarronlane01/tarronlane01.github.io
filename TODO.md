# To do

Summarize, organize, and re-word this to make sure the instructions are clear.

Let's add another tab to transactions called Transfers. This will need it's own array of values on the month objects, replicated in similar way as the income and spend are set up. These will be like spend, but they will be for moving money into, out of, or between accounts/categories. These should allow specifying a from account/category and a to account/category (changing account and/or categor). These should require both sides of the equation. Any changes here should mark current and future months as needing recalc, just like for income/spend. Dont show any grant totals on this page, since it will be moving money around potentially between all accounts/categories so there's nothing really that makes sense to total. Make sure all recalc logic takes into account rows in this array for each month. As part of this, the spend page should now NOT allow no-account and no-category selections. These should only be available on the transfers tab. Write a migration that will move all spends in the database to be transfers instead (Have the from/to not ALWAYS require both sides, so that we can support things like adjustments in transfers as well) Actually, have a second tab called adjustments, and that will be the versions of transfers that are one-sided that allow EITHER no-account or no-category. In the migration we write to move things to their right place, let's also find any entries that have non-valid accounts/categories like "unknown" to the no-account or no-category balance.
