# To do

Let's change how we're doing tabs on the month pages. Let's have two top-level tabs called Balances and Transactions, then under balances we will have categories and accounts, and under transactions we will have income and spend. Make this udpate, and make sure all our page navigation is updated for this new structure, Have all these month views in one folder for month views, aka MonthIncome, MonthSpend, MonthCategories, etc. still.

Let's add another tab to transactions called Transfers. This will need it's own array of values on the month objects, replicated in similar way as the income and spend are set up. These will be like spend, but they will be for moving money into, out of, or between accounts/categories. These should allow specifying a from account/category and a to account/category (changing account and/or categor). These should require both sides of the equation. Any changes here should mark current and future months as needing recalc, just like for income/spend. Dont show any grant totals on this page, since it will be moving money around potentially between all accounts/categories so there's nothing really that makes sense to total. Make sure all recalc logic takes into account rows in this array for each month.
