- There should be two "ghost" options, one for category and one for account: "No Category" and "No Account"

- These should not show up when editing accounts or categories from the budget settings page, but should show up when selecting category or account from dropdowns, including as part of the data import process

- These should not track balances, but are used for when we don't want the transaction to affect a category or account

- For the spend page, we should validate that account and category are not both the NO option
- For income, don't show the no account option
- For allocations, don't show the no category option
